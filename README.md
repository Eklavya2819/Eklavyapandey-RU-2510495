🚆 Railway Ticket Booking System (C Mini Project)

📚 Academic Information

Course: B.Tech (CSE/Related)
Semester: First Semester
Subject: C Programming
Project Type: Minor Project

📌 Project Overview

This project is a menu-driven Railway Ticket Booking System developed using the C programming language.
It allows users to view seat availability, book seats, and cancel bookings using an array-based approach.
This project is created as a First Semester C Programming Minor Project, focusing on core programming concepts taught in the initial stage of B.Tech.

🎯 Aim

The aim of this project is to:
Design a simple railway seat reservation system
Implement array-based seat management
Apply conditional statements, loops, functions, and switch-case
Simulate real-life booking and cancellation logic

🛠️ Utility

This system provides the following utilities:
View current seat availability
Book a seat if it is available
Cancel an existing seat booking
Prevent invalid seat selection
User-friendly menu-driven interface
The project helps beginners understand how a basic reservation system works internally.

🎯 Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to:
Strengthen fundamental C programming concepts
Practice functions, arrays, loops, and conditions
Learn logical thinking and problem-solving
Build confidence in creating real-world console-based applications
It serves as a foundational step towards more advanced programming and system design.

🔮 Future Scope

This project can be enhanced further by:
Increasing the number of seats dynamically
Adding passenger details (name, age, gender)
Implementing file handling to save booking data
Adding multiple coaches and seat categories
Converting it into a GUI-based application
Extending it into a full Railway Reservation Management System

🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

Programming Language: C
